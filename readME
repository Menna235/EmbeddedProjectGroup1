See wiki page for the detailed description of the project.

In this repo, you will find two directories: demo 1 and demo 2.

How to build: 
In order to build our project, you need to download the source code under the demo 2 directory and load it on the microcontroller. For the hardware part, you need to enable a timer with different channels and each channel is connected to a LED. Each sensor will be coresponding to a LED that turns on after reading a signal. 
You can see the circuit in the wiki page.
